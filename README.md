# NGEMobile
## Purpose
This is a demo repository for HCL Accelerate and Launch. 

## How to Use
Accelerate will connect to this repository to show the code commits here and link it back to [JIRA project](https://accelerate-stevenckwong.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/NM/boards/4).
This repository will be used by Jenkins in a local setup for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.
Accelerate will also work with that Jenkins to provide the end-to-end traceability demo.
